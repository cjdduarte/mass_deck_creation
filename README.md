<b>#### About:</b>

This addon is designed for users who need to create multiple Anki decks quickly and efficiently. It allows you to define a structure for decks and subdecks using a simple text format and create them all in one go.

<b>Example:</b>

Below is an example of how you can structure your deck creation input:

```
Deck1::Subdeck1
Deck1::Subdeck2
Deck2
Deck2::Subdeck1
```

This will create two main decks, **Deck1** and **Deck2**, each with subdecks as shown in the structure.

<b>#### Configuration option:</b>

There are no specific configuration options for this addon. However, the dialog allows you to input your custom deck structure directly. Simply follow the `::` notation to indicate subdecks.

<b>#### How to Use:</b>

1. After installing the addon, navigate to the **Tools** menu in Anki.
2. Select **Mass Deck Creation** from the dropdown.
3. A dialog will appear where you can input the deck structure you want to create. You can also use the example structure provided in the dialog as a guide.
4. Click **OK** to create the decks in Anki.
